        <h2>Introduction to ROS 2</h2>
        <p>ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) is a flexible framework for writing robot software. It provides a collection of tools, libraries, and conventions that aim to simplify the task of creating complex and robust robot behavior across a wide variety of robot platforms.</p>

        <p>Key features of ROS 2 include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Improved support for real-time systems</li>
            <li>Better tools for distributed systems</li>
            <li>Enhanced security features</li>
            <li>Quality of service settings for message passing</li>
        </ul>

        <p>ROS 2 uses a client library approach that allows developers to write nodes in different programming languages and have them communicate seamlessly. The most common client libraries are rclcpp for C++ and rclpy for Python.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content">
        <h2>Digital Twin Simulation</h2>
        <p>A digital twin is a virtual representation of a physical system that can be used for simulation, analysis, and optimization. In the context of humanoid robotics, digital twins allow developers to test control algorithms, sensor configurations, and behavioral patterns in a safe, virtual environment before deploying to physical robots.</p>

        <p>Gazebo is a popular simulation environment that integrates well with ROS 2. It provides realistic physics simulation, sensor simulation, and a rich set of models for robots and environments.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content">
        <h2>AI Perception Systems</h2>
        <p>Perception is a critical component of intelligent humanoid robots. Modern perception systems combine multiple sensors including cameras, LiDAR, IMUs, and force/torque sensors to build a comprehensive understanding of the environment.</p>

        <p>Computer vision algorithms process visual information to detect objects, recognize faces, track motion, and understand scenes. Deep learning models, particularly convolutional neural networks, have revolutionized the field of computer vision in robotics.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content">
        <h2>Humanoid Robot Control</h2>
        <p>Controlling humanoid robots presents unique challenges due to their complex kinematics and dynamics. Balance control is particularly important for bipedal robots, requiring sophisticated control algorithms that can maintain stability while performing various tasks.</p>

        <p>Common control approaches include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Model Predictive Control (MPC)</li>
            <li>Whole-body control</li>
            <li>Learning-based control</li>
            <li>Adaptive control for changing environments</li>
        </ul>
