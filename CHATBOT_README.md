# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book - Chatbot Integration

This project includes an AI-powered chatbot that can answer questions about the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics educational content using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

## Architecture

The chatbot consists of two main components:

1. **Frontend Chatbot Widget**: A React component that provides the user interface for interacting with the chatbot, integrated into the Docusaurus site via the Root component
2. **RAG API Backend**: A Python FastAPI server with advanced RAG capabilities that processes queries against the book content using vector embeddings and OpenAI

## Running the Application

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- uv package manager
- OpenAI API key

### Setup

1. Install Python dependencies using uv:
```bash
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Process the book content for the RAG system:
```bash
python run_ingestion.py
```

### Running in Development

You can run both servers simultaneously:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start:
- Docusaurus site on http://localhost:3000/Physical-AI-Humanoid-Robotics-Book/
- Python RAG API server on http://localhost:8000/

### Running Servers Separately

To run just the API server:
```bash
uv run main.py
```

To run just the Docusaurus site:
```bash
npm run start
```

## API Endpoints

- `GET /health` - Health check
- `POST /chat` - Query the RAG system with a question

## How It Works

1. The chatbot widget appears as a floating button on all pages of the Docusaurus site
2. When users ask questions, they are sent to the RAG API
3. The API searches through the processed book content to find relevant information
4. The most relevant content is returned and displayed to the user

## Configuration

The chatbot API URL can be configured using the `REACT_APP_API_URL` environment variable. By default, it connects to `http://localhost:8000`.
