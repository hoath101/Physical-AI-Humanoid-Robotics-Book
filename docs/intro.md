# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book! This comprehensive educational resource is designed to bridge the gap between digital intelligence and physical robotic bodies, teaching you how to create embodied AI systems.

## What is Physical AI?

Physical AI represents the convergence of artificial intelligence and physical systems. Rather than AI existing purely in digital form, Physical AI brings intelligence into the physical world through robotic bodies. This creates a feedback loop where AI systems can perceive, interact with, and learn from the physical environment.

## The Learning Pathway

This book follows a structured learning pathway that takes you from foundational concepts to advanced autonomous behaviors:

1. **Robotic Middleware** - Understanding ROS 2 and communication patterns
2. **Simulation & Digital Twins** - Creating virtual environments for testing
3. **AI Perception & Navigation** - Enabling robots to understand their environment
4. **Vision-Language-Action** - Natural interaction with robotic systems
5. **Capstone Integration** - Bringing all concepts together

## Target Audience

This book is designed for students with a computer science or AI background who want to:
- Understand the fundamentals of humanoid robotics
- Learn to integrate AI systems with physical robots
- Develop skills in ROS 2, simulation environments, and AI frameworks
- Apply embodied intelligence concepts in practical scenarios

## Prerequisites

Before diving into this book, you should have:
- Basic programming experience (Python preferred)
- Understanding of fundamental AI concepts
- Familiarity with Linux command line
- Basic knowledge of robotics concepts (helpful but not required)

## Technical Requirements

To follow along with the practical exercises, you'll need:
- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (or Windows with WSL2)
- ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill or later
- Gazebo Garden or compatible simulation environment
- NVIDIA Isaac Sim (for AI perception modules)
- Node.js 18+ for the book environment

## How to Use This Book

Each module builds upon the previous one, but is designed to be independently testable. You can:
- Follow the modules sequentially for a complete learning experience
- Focus on specific modules based on your interests
- Complete the hands-on exercises to reinforce concepts
- Use the capstone project to integrate all learned concepts

Let's begin your journey into Physical AI and humanoid robotics!
