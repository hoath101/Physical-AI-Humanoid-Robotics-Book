# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

Welcome to the first module of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book! In this module, you'll learn about ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2), the foundational middleware that enables communication and coordination in robotic systems.

## Overview

ROS 2 serves as the "nervous system" of robotic applications, providing the infrastructure for different components to communicate with each other. In this module, we'll cover:

- Core ROS 2 concepts: nodes, topics, services, and actions
- Python programming with rclpy
- URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) for robot modeling
- Practical exercises to build your first ROS 2 applications

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Understand the architecture and communication patterns of ROS 2
- Create and run basic ROS 2 nodes in Python
- Work with topics, services, and actions for inter-component communication
- Define robot models using URDF
- Execute practical exercises with simulated humanoid robots

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, ensure you have:

- ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill installed
- Basic Python programming knowledge
- Familiarity with command-line tools
- Completed the book's introduction

## Module Structure

This module is organized into the following sections:

1. **Nodes, Topics, Services** - Understanding ROS 2 communication primitives
2. **rclpy Basics** - Python client library for ROS 2
3. **URDF Description** - Robot modeling and description format
4. **Practical Exercises** - Hands-on applications with humanoid robots

## Next Steps

Begin with the next section to dive into ROS 2 communication patterns. Each section builds on the previous one, so follow the sequence for the best learning experience.
