# Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)

Welcome to Module 3 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book! This module focuses on the AI components that power modern robotics: perception, navigation, and intelligent decision-making using NVIDIA Isaac technologies.

## Overview

In this module, you'll learn to integrate AI systems with your humanoid robot, enabling it to perceive its environment, navigate autonomously, and make intelligent decisions. We'll leverage NVIDIA Isaac technologies to build an "AI brain" for your robot.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Set up and configure NVIDIA Isaac Sim for robotics simulation
- Implement Visual SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) systems
- Integrate Isaac ROS packages for perception and navigation
- Perform VSLAM (Visual SLAM) for robot localization and mapping
- Configure Nav2 for humanoid locomotion and navigation
- Create autonomous navigation behaviors for humanoid robots
- Generate synthetic data for AI training using Isaac Sim
- Integrate multiple sensors for robust perception

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, ensure you have:

- Completed Module 1 (ROS 2 fundamentals)
- Completed Module 2 (Digital Twin simulation)
- Basic understanding of computer vision concepts
- Access to an NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support (recommended)
- Isaac Sim installed (covered in this module)
